					<h2>Fast Fashion</h2>
					<P class="padding-b">Over the course of the last 20 years the way people buy, wear and discard clothing has changed dramatically. Companies like H&M, Zara, Target and dozens of businesses are behind a wave of unsustainable and oft times unethical new trend of “fast fashion”. Defined as “inexpensive clothing produced rapidly by mass-market retailers in response to the latest trends.” </P>

							<h3>What is Fast Fashion?</h3>
							<p>Defined as “inexpensive clothing produced rapidly by mass-market retailers in response to the latest trends.” Fast fashion is controverersial for many reasons.   Global transport and shipping costs very low and buyers in countries like the United States and the Uk are purchasing more clothing then ever before. </p>
						</div>

					<div class="featured-box">
						<div class="featured-box-col1 wow fadeInRight delay-04s">
							<i class="fa fa-gbp"></i>
						</div>
						<div class="featured-box-col2 wow fadeInRight delay-04s">
							<p>Typically much cheaper then higher end designers, mass retailers offer buyers a varying selection of styles and are able to keep up with the changing trends by sourcing their manufacturing from low median income countries like Bangladesh or China. This insures that the cost of each individual garment will remain low once it reaches the marketplace. </p>

							<i class="fas fa-shopping-bag"></i>
						</div>
						<div class="featured-box-col2 wow fadeInRight delay-06s">
							<p>However, the price is also reflective of the value the buyer places on the garment as in many cases the lifespan of fast fashion pieces does not elapse a year.  This in turn has caused garment consumption to reach levels previously unseen. </p>

						</div>
							<p>Consumerism is at an all time high and fast fashion is wreaking havoc on our environment in many ways that buyers are not aware of. Typically, most clothing produced in the realm of fast fashion is derived from either cotton or polyester. Both of these products produce grave effects on human health and also the environment.</p>

						<div class="service-list-col2">
						<div class=text-justify>
							<p>Cotton depletes aquaphors of water and also takes numerous harsh chemicals and pesticides to grow. Polyester is synthetic material that is created when processed from oil. The dying of these materials is now causing our local water systems to contain high levels of heavy metals and other noxious chemicals that are detrimental to all living things. </p>

						</div>
						<div class=text-justify>
							<p>Fast fashion garments are produced in high quantities and at cheap prices. This means that they are easily replaceable. Waste from the high fashion industry is often overlooked by the consumer. In 2015 the average American disposed of 80lbs of clothing. In the United Kingdom, the average person disposed 26 kilograms of clothing annually. American citizens throw away more clothing every year then any country in the world and the United Kingdom tosses more fat fashion into the trash then any country in Europe. </p>

						 <div class=text-justify>
							<p>With an already encumbered waste removal system. Fast fashion is becoming a bigger and bigger problem for waste removal. While up cycling and reusing clothing provides some relief. Many of the clothes that are donated becomes soiled or damaged before they reach 2nd hand shops and can no longer be sold. </p>

							<h3>Women</h3>
							<p>Throughout history women have typically been employed in the creation of textiles used to make clothing. Today, a majority of big box fast fashion stores use countries like Bangladesh to produce their garments. Bangladesh has regulated its minimum wage in an attempt to compete in the global economy.  Low production cost guarantees that companies like Zara or H&M will use their country as a place of employment. Women in the garment industry in Bangladesh are working for wages as low as $38 a month. Not only is minimum wage pay very low but working conditions are also inhumane and dangerous. In 2013, the world watched as over 1,000 people, almost exclusively women, were killed in a factory collapse in Dhaka district in Bangladesh.</p>

							<h3>Children</h3>
							<p>While most countries around the world prohibit children from working in factories, many of these countries are able to bypass this. ‘Sweatshops’ are factories where children are often forced to work to support their families. The clothing chain and garment industry is a very complex system as many of the clothing makers do not know where the source of their material is coming from. Children are often separated from their homes and trafficked and forced into labor, picking cotton to make into textiles that will be used to create clothing.</p>

							<h3>Low and Middle Income Countries</h3>
							<div class=text-justify>
							<p>Individuals who work or live near factories that manufacture textile are disproportionately affected by environmental health hazards. Around 90% of garments sold in the USA are made using polyester or cotton; these fibers both can cause significant impacts on a persons’ health both in manufacturing and production. Additionally, an increase in consumer consumption results in an increase of waste; millions of tons of textile waste ends up in landfills each year or in unregulated settings detrimental to the environment and health.</p>
